## A brief aside on chat apps, generally

I really dislike chat apps for work.

Are there use cases where they're valuable? Sure, but the number of ways in which they can enforce bad habits vastly outnumber the scenarios where they're making a positive impact, in my view.

That's a tricky topic to tackle, though, and I don't think there's currently a great solution or alternative for remote teams outside of documentation that most folks aren't going to read anyways.

## What does online status even mean?

Something I _hope_ we can all agree on, though, is how utterly useless and annoying status bubbles in apps are. Let's pretend that the [Lucky Framework](https://luckyframework.org) [Discord chat](https://luckyframework.org/chat) is a company:

How do you interpret these statuses? Here's one take:

- Jamie, Jeremy, and Rob are online and working diligently. I can chat with them about anything I may need to talk through. Sweet!
- Alex is busily coding, probably on something very important for their status to be "Busy" or "Do not Disturb". I should probably leave them alone.
- Stephen is away from the computer and probably not busy. What a slacker!

## Must... keep... the bubble... green!

When I was discussing my dislike of chat apps with my lovely wife, Avery, we realized that the fear that people actually interpret our status bubbles like this drives us to want a green bubble _at any cost_.

Taking a break for lunch? I'll just eat at my desk rather than going outside and having lunch on the patio, that way no one thinks I'm slacking off too much.
