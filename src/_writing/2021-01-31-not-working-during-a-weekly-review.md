## Introduction

Weekly reviews are hard to do consistently. Even if you *do* them consistently, they're still hard to do well. Getting Things Done creator, David Allen, has noted that [a consistent, complete weekly review practice is key to making GTD stick](https://youtu.be/5r_vlIbBrRc?t=97).

I've struggled with this a lot recently, mainly due to the fact that the nature of the work in my day-job at [Tuple](https://tuple.app) has changed. In previous roles, I had a set of relatively well-defined roles, as well as pretty obvious metrics for success. As Tuple's Chief of Staff, my projects and priorities are constantly shifting and evolving with my boss, [Ben](https://twitter.com/r00k), and the business. This results in *lots* of inputs, many of which I could convince myself could be accomplished [within two minutes](https://gettingthingsdone.com/2020/05/the-two-minute-rule-2).

In the last month, my weekly reviews have gone a lot like this:

- I head over to my OmniFocus inbox to start clarifying.
- I see an action like `Respond to Ben with plan for weekly updates` with a link to an email thread in Gmail. "Great, I can write that email in two minutes!"
- Switch to Gmail, send the email to Ben, then notice that I have a Help Scout notification. Customer X just responded to a sales quote, and I can **definitely** get back to them in two minutes.
