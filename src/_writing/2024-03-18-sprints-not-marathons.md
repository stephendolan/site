You've probably heard the common phrase "We're running a marathon, not a sprint", meant to reinforce working at a reasonable pace, avoiding burn-out, and being reasonable about commitments.

For the biggest efforts in life like building a company, building personal wealth, having a healthy relationship with a partner, or raising a child, I'm on board. Lean into that marathon mindset and let's jog.

But when I get to my desk in the morning to work, I'm not doing it with a marathon mindset - I'm sprinting. I spend an appropriate amount of time organizing my life so that projects and next actions are clear; if I meander my way through the day, it both squanders the value of getting _really good_ at GTD™️ task management and misses out on the opportunity to feel like I've absolutely crushed it.

## This approach isn't for everyone

Some people love to go to the gym and spend hours there; they'll do a set every 5-10 minutes, catching up with friends or their phone for a roughly similar amount of time. They get a huge amount of value from the time to mentally and socially decompress, and end up with a lovely side effect of having done a workout.

When I'm working out, though, I'm cranking through those sets as fast as I can; no phone, no chat, and only enough breaks to stay safe. For me, the value is in knowing that I _attacked_ the thing I set out to do and succeeded.
